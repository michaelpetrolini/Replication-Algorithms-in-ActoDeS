# Replication-Algorithms-in-ActoDeS
Project for the course of "Distributed Systems" (2020-2021) at UniPR (IT)

The project involved the implementation in ActoDeS of the three main replication algorithms, taking into account the possible failures and therefore the recovery activities:
  - Passive replication
  - Active replication
  - Quorum-based replication
